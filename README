Instructions
------------

This script searches a LaTeX file for citekeys, and tries to match citekeys
in the form author:year:page to the NASA ADS database. For cite keys that
successfully resolve to a unique article, the script downloads the BibTeX
entry and appends it to a file called [original]_auto.bib where [original] is
the original name of the input file, with the .tex extension stripped. For
example, the following command

$ python auto_bibtex.py ms.tex

will produce an output file called ms_auto.bib. This bibliography can then
be included in the LaTeX file with

\bibliography{ms_auto, custom}

where custom.bib would contain any references not resolved by ADS.

Notes
-----

- This script assumes the year is given in 2-digit form, e.g. 83 for 1983
